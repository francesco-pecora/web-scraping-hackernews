# web-scraping-hackernews

Application that scrapes information from HackerNews and displays the current top voted news (with 100+ votes). The app is implemented in Python, using Flask to implement the server. 

Requirements.txt holds all the packages needed to run the application. 

Run this command in the root file of the project to set up the packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the packages are set, run this line to start the application in localhost (make sure 'python' refers to python version 3):

```
python .\server.py
```
